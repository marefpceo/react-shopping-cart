# React Shopping Cart

[One Stop Shop](https://react-shopping-cart-4ft.pages.dev)

## Objective:

Create a mock shopping cart using React. The requirements to this project were as follows:

- Plan component and folder structure

- Minumum of two pages (a home page and a shop page, which includes shopping cart)

- Navigate between pages using navigation bar, which will be shown on all pages

- Include images on homepage (nothing fancy, just enough to test basic concepts)

- Shopping cart page should dislay the number of items currently in the cart

- Build individual card elements for each product

- Product cards must include:

  - Input field
  - Option to manually input quantity
  - Increment/ decrement buttons to adjust quantity
  - Product title and description
  - "Add To Cart" button

- Fetch shop items from an API

  - [Dummy JSON](https://dummyjson.com) API's were used
